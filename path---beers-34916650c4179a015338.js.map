It is a Roman Catholic religious order of cloistered contemplative monastics who strictly follow the Rule of St. Benedict. Many of the rules have been relaxed since they were written in the 6th century. However, a fundamental tenet, that monasteries should be self-supporting, is still maintained by these groups. Following this rule, most Trappist monasteries produce a wide range of goods that are sold to provide income for the monastery. They are probably most famous for their beers, which are unique within the beer world. \\nThere are ten Trappist breweries in the world from which six in Belgium: Westmalle, Westvleteren, Achel, Chimay, Orval and Rochefort. Their beers are easy to recognize thanks to the hexagonal logo of an Authentic Trappist Product (www.trappist.be), which means that the beer was brewed within or in the close vicinity of the walls of a Trappist monastery under supervision of the trappist monks. \\nThe brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and there should be no intention to make profit. Margins are in this philosophy less important and the trappist monks have less pressure to reduce costs. They have no problem to use the best, more expensive ingredients, guarantee for a product of top quality. The main goal is to cover the expenses of the trappist monks, and what remains should be donated to charity. Drinking a Trappist beer is therefore always a bit charity (beside the pleasure it offers). \\nThe Trappist association has a legal standing, and its logo gives the consumer some information and guarantees about the product.

Further on the brewery has to pay royalties to the abbey and the abbey may also check the marketing strategy and publicity material. \\nIn order to guarantee the name is not misused for marketing purposes, the breweries and religious orders have created an authenticity logo, which reads Erkend Belgisch Abdijbier (Recognised Belgian Abbey Beer, see www.belgianbrewers.be). In order to use the logo the beers have to comply with a minimum of conditions. It’s a Belgian label and only applies to Belgian beer. \\nGood to know is that every Trappist beer also is an Abbey beer as the conditions to wear the Authentic Trappist Product logo are stricter than the ones for an Abbey beer.

The normal (ordinary) beer was named ‘single’ and was drunk by the ordinary laborers and monks. This beer was good enough for them, but people with more esteem and money wanted a better product. To fulfil the desire of those rich customers the brewers made heavier beer (using more malt). \\nTransporters and bar owners were often not able to read in that period. The brewer therefor marked his barrels with (chalk) crosses. One cross on ordinary barrels, two on barrels with heavier beer (dubbel beer) and three on the heaviest stuff (tripel beer). \\nThe terms single, dubbel (double) and tripel (triple) have nothing to do with the yeasting or maturation process of the beer, as often is presumed. It refers to the amount of raw materials (malts and cereals) used. The more material, the heavier the beer. A double is heavier than a single but it hasn’t to be twice as heavy neither that twice the quantity of raw material is used. \\nActually the term ‘single’ is in disuse but some breweries use the term ‘extra’ instead to denominate their light, thirst quenching beer. In addition a couple of brewers also launched some ‘quadruples’, with even more alcohol. \\nNowadays we usually associate a dubbel with a dark beer and a tripel with a blonde beer, but this isn’t a must.
